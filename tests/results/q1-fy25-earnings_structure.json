The joint venture combines Star-branded entertainment and sports television channels, Disney+ Hotstar, and certain RIL-controlled media businesses, with RIL holding a 56% controlling interest, the Company holding 37%, and a third-party investment company holding 7%. The Company now recognizes its 37% share of the joint venture\u2019s results under \"Equity in the income of investees.\" Additionally, the document provides financial results for the Entertainment segment, showing a 9% increase in total revenues and a 95% increase in operating income compared to the prior-year quarter. The growth in operating income is attributed to improved results in Content Sales/Licensing and Direct-to-Consumer, partially offset by a decline in Linear Networks."
